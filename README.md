## Getting Started

This challenge is made up of 6 parts that can be completed in any order. The challenge itself is not made to get fully finished, focus on getting through the questions you know. Each part within this test is built such that the questions get progressively more difficult, that is Challenge 1.5 is going to be more difficult than challenge 1.1. Use all resources available, including our hiring team, if you have a question reach out to us and we will get back to you when we can. Throughtout the challenges you will see the type `IMPLEMENT` being used, this represents areas that you must replace `IMPLEMENT` with a different type. In other areas you will encounter commented out code, this code should be used as a guide.
